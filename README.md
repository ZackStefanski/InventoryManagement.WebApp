# InventoryManagement.WebApp
Welcome! This project is an inventory management web applicate for a fictional music store. Having been given access to it, you are now able to add, edit, delete, reinstate, and export all the data and information in this database of music equipment.
The code for this project was developed using the MVC format, and the database is managed using SQLite.

The website will initialize the database upon clicking the "Inventory" or "Employees" tab. If this does not succeed, please close the application, delete the "Inventory.db" file, and try again. Having said this, I do not anticipate this being a problem.

The features I use in this program are the following...
 - Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
 - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
 - Make at least one unit test.

Thank you!
